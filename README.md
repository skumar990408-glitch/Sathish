Hi,

This project was developed using Playwright with Java for UI automation, and RestAssured for API testing. I have used TestNG as the test framework. I have added dependencies for RestAssured, Playwright, Maven, reporting, and other base libraries.

Using a TestNG suite, I trigger the test cases via the testng.xml file (which I have attached).

For the API automation, I encountered some errors and I took some time to debug them. For UI test cases, I also invested time writing the automation. Though I didnâ€™t get to automate every requirement fully, I have covered as much as possible on my side and pushed all the work in the repository.

I believe I have designed this framework from scratch and learned many new things in the process. Thanks for the opportunity!
